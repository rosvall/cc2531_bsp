// Reset=00 R/W Timer interval select.
// These bits select the timer interval, which is defined as a given number
// of 32 kHz oscillator periods.

// interval must be set at the same time as the timer is started.

// For CC253x and CC2540, when clock division is enabled through CLKCONCMD.CLKSPD, the
// length of the watchdog timer interval is reduced by a factor equal to the current oscillator clock
// frequency divided by the set clock speed. For example, if the 32-MHz crystal is selected and the
// clock speed is set to 4 MHz, then the watchdog timeout is reduced by a factor of 32 MHz / 4 MHz =
// 8. If the watchdog interval set by WDCTL.INT was 1 s, nominally it is 1 / 8 s with this clock division
// factor. For CC2541, the watchdog timer interval is independent of the clock division rate.

// has no effect. When operating in timer mode, the timer can be cleared to 0x0000 (but not stopped)
// by writing 1 to CLR[0] (the other 3 bits are don't care).
